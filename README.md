Agent-Based Model of the Spanish Housing Market
===============================================

This project aims at building an agent-based model of the Spanish housing market, based on the model developed for the UK by the Institute of New Economic Thinking at the University of Oxford and the Bank of England.
Intended as a tool for assessing the impact of central bank regulation on the corresponding housing market, the model incorporates owner-occupiers, renters, buy-to-let investors, a housing market, a rental market, a private mortgage lender or bank and a central bank.
A more detailed description of the original UK model can be found at this
